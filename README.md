# Viral Genomics in Postpartum Cardiomyopathy

## Project Overview
This graduate research project investigates the detection of cardiotropic viruses in human cardiac tissue samples using PCR and RT-PCR workflows. The objective is to compare viral presence across cardiac layers and control groups to better understand potential viral contributions to postpartum cardiomyopathy.

## My Role
Graduate Researcher – University of New Haven (2025–Present)

- Performed DNA and RNA extraction from human cardiac tissues
- Conducted PCR and RT-PCR assays for viral detection
- Assisted in comparative analysis across tissue layers
- Maintained laboratory documentation and quality control practices

## Techniques Used
- DNA/RNA Extraction
- PCR / RT-PCR
- Tissue homogenization
- Gel electrophoresis
- Molecular diagnostics workflows

## Skills Demonstrated
Molecular biology, experimental design, laboratory documentation, data organization, troubleshooting, quality control.

## Project Status
Ongoing research (expected completion: May 2026)
